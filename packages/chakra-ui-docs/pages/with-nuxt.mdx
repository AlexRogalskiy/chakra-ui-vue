# Usage with Nuxt.js

üíö We all love Nuxt.js! Getting started with Nuxt.js is also just as simple.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/nuxt
```

## Registering the Chakra module
You then register the Chakra UI module in the `modules` key of our `nuxt.config.js`.
[See the Nuxt documentation to learn more about modules in Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/modules)

Chakra module options are the same as the Vue CLI plugin options.
Learn more about the [Chakra plugin options here](/plugin-options).

```js
export default {
  modules: [
    '@chakra-ui/nuxt'
  ],
  // extend the plugin options under the `chakra` key
  chakra: {
    // ...
  }
}
```

You then wrap your layouts in the `layouts/` directory inside the `CThemeProvider` component so that all your
Chakra UI components can access the theme object.

```vue
<template>
  <c-theme-provider>
    <c-preset />
    <nuxt />
    <c-button as="nuxt-link" to="/my-other-page">
      ‚ö°Ô∏è Oh, my Nuxt!
    </c-button>
  </c-theme-provider>
</template>
```

üéâ _Voila!_ You're ready to start using Chakra UI Vue in your Nuxt.js app!


## Advanced
If you're looking to get more out of Chakra UI in Nuxt, we've documented a few of the features that
the `@chakra-ui/nuxt` module ships out of the box and how they work.

### Auto-importing of Chakra UI Vue components.

Notice that in the basic setup, we don't locally register the `CButton` & `CThemeProvider` components
in the template before using them.

By default, Chakra UI Vue dynamically analyzes your template during development and **only
registers the components that you use in the template** without having to manually import and
register them locally in the template. Chakra UI Vue is able to achieve this through the official
[`@nuxt/components`](https://github.com/nuxt/components) module to achieve this.

This helps you conveniently use Chakra UI Vue components without importing & registering all components globally,
and completely sacrificing your application's performance. Tree-shaking works out of the box for all consumed
Chakra UI Vue components. 

If you want to get even performance (smaller bundle size) for your application, [you can opt out of this feature.](#opt-out-of-import-on-demand.)

### Opt out of import on demand.
Using the default `importOnDemand` feature of Chakra UI Vue in Nuxt comes with one tradeoff - it loads about
[**~10KB**](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui-vue/pull/220#issue-424013613) of Javascript to the Nuxt
application's entry. We hope to make this zero in the future. We're working with the Nuxt team to improve this feature.

To disable the import on demand feature, simply set the `importOnDemand`  option to false in the Chakra options in your `nuxt.config.js`

> Disbaling the `importOnDemand` feature will require you to manually import Chakra components before using them.

```js
export default {
  modules: [
    '@chakra-ui/nuxt'
  ],
  chakra: {
    // Disables template scanning and auto-import of used
    // Chakra components.
    importOnDemand: false
  }
}
```
